# Singleton Pattern Study
[Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a programming pattern with intent defined by [Source Making](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/singleton) as purposed to:
>Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

This project has implemented the pattern to handle redundant singleton avoidance as explained in [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)'s book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html).
